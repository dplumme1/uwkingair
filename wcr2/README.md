In this directory find examples of IDL routines that read and process WCR2 data.
Note that these are merely examples and there are embedded functions that are not provided here.

If you would like more information on the routines or to find out about obtaining the
full library (WCR2TOOLS) please contact:

Dr. Samuel Haimov (haimov@uwyo.edu)

Below is information from Sam:

Wcr2tools library provides idl routines to work with the WCR (WCR2) raw data 
files, UW KingAir data files, NCAR C130 aircraft, and WCR data archived in 
netCDF files after August 2009. Before August 2009 an obsolete WCRTOOLS
library must be used for handling raw and processed data. It is associated 
with the previous(retired) WCR hardware/software (WCR1).A few of the routines
in WCRTOOLS library are either used or useful for WCR2 and are described below.

It is expected that this library and the authors of the routines used
will be acknowledged by the users if the results of its use are published.

Generally, the use of the library requires Samuel Haimov's idltools idl library 
and Ray Sterner's jhuapl idl library. You need to set the IDL path to include
the IDL directories for wcr2tools, idltools and jhuapl.



Following is a list of the available idl routines with short descriptions.
The same information is accessable within idl by executing wcrtools.pro routine
(IDL> wcrtools).  Every routine includes a keyword HELP providing additional
information.  More general information is available in the Readme file in
idltools library.

             EARTH to AC coordinate transformation matrix (WCRTOOLS library).
wcrdopcor  - Returns WCR radial Doppler velocity corrected for AC motion.

             other AC data variables from a netCDF file. 
             There is only one time dimension in the loaded
             variables. See the notes.  Time variable is 
             resampled to match data sampling rate (sps).

             with a WCR2 configuration

             uncorrected Doppler. 

##Reading variables from AC, WCR or WCR/AC NetCDF files

ac2loadnc        - returns KingAir or NCAR C130 aircraft data 
                   variable from a netCDF file. There is only one

##Miscelaneous routines related to WCR and AC NetCDF data

wcr2calthreshnc - return thresholded reflectivity in dBZ
                  Optionally it can also return thresholded Doppler
                  velocity field (expnded version of wcr2threshnc)

                  selected WCR2  netcdf files

                reflectivity(or velocity) resampled into the vertical plane and 
                adjusted for the radar altitude. Deviations of the beam(s) in the 
                horizontal plane are ignored (horizontal homogeneity is assumed). 
                If beam(s) pointing angles are not given assume no deviation from

                (WCRTOOLS library).
wcrud2udnc  -   Returns the combined reflectivity or velocity field (nrg, nrpofs).  
                from the 'up' and the 'down' WCR beams. The ranges added in the
                gap between the first valid 'up' and 'down' gates are filled with 
                missing values.  The missing values of the output are always NaN.
                (WCRTOOLS library).
wcrwdvnc    -   Adjust the airborne radar radial Doppler velocity from the 
                Up/Down-pointing antenna for horizontal wind contribution.
                The routine uses Doppler velocity already corrected for the 
                aircraft motion contribution.
                (WCRTOOLS library).
h2omwir     -   Returns complex refraction index of pure water/ice for a given
