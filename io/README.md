File IO routines.

This directory contains Python routines that read UWKA flight data files.

A "simplified" Level 2 user file can be produced using the combination of
```make_uwka_l2_flight.py``` and ```l2_setup.py```. Instructions are 
contained within the files. At this time this is an experimental product.
